# better-issues

> A GitHub App built with [Probot][probot-repo] that enhances issue management

## Motivation
I usually work with tags in my projects, and relly heavilly on labels for managing stuff, and always come with the idea of automatic closing of labels based on some [rules][rules].  
Lets say our project is planing on releasing version `v2.0.0`, so all feature request and bug fixes that are included in that version will have the label `v2.0.0`.  
Then when version is released you must close all those issues manually, or done in the moment of fixing... but I usually prefer to close them when version is released.  
This comes to help that specific problem.
